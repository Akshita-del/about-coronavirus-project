<!--What Are Viruses?-->
<div class="first">

<A NAME=Section1></A>
<p><h3>What Are Viruses?</h3></p>
	<p>A microorganism that is smaller than a bacterium that cannot grow or reproduce apart from a living cell. A virus invades living cells and uses their chemical machinery to keep itself alive and to replicate itself. It may reproduce with fidelity or with errors (mutations); this ability to mutate is responsible for the ability of some viruses to change slightly in each infected person, making treatment difficult. Viruses cause many common human infections and are also responsible for a number of rare diseases.</p>

<!--Structure Of Coronaviruses-->
	<div class="content-area">
	<A NAME=Section2></A>
	<p><h3>Structure of Coronaviruses</h3></p>
	<div class="image"><IMG SRC= Structure.png></div>
	<p>Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections. Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200nm in diameter. The total molecular weight is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.</p>
	<p>The viral envelop is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored. The ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300. The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size. S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells. But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein. The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron-dense shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the electron beam used to scan the virus particle)</p>

<! --Impact Of Coronavirus In Human Lives-->
	<div class="content-area">
<A NAME=Section4></A>
<p><h3>Impact Of Coronavirus In Human Lives</h3></p>
	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.</p>
	<p>Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world's 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food. The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most marginalised populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit.</p>

<!--Timeline Of The Coronavirus Pandemic-->
	<div class="content-area">
<A NAME=Section5></A>
<p><h3>Timeline Of The Coronavirus Pandemic</h3></p>
	<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009. Illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 was termed COVID-19 by the WHO, the acronym derived from "coronavirus disease 2019."</p>

In Different Countries Of The World (per 100K)</h3></p>
	<CENTER><IMG SRC= deaths.png width= 800px></CENTER>
</div>

<!-- Which countries were least affected and why?-->
<div class="content-area">
	<A NAME=Section9></A>
	<p><h3>Which Countries Were Least Affected And Why?</h3></p>
	<h4>Tuvalu</h4>
	<p>Located about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, Tuvalu is made up of three reef islands and six atolls, with a combined area of approximately 10 square miles and a population of over 10,000. The independent nation, a member of the Commonwealth, has seen success in closing its borders to travel, with a mandatory quarantine in some cases.</p>
	<div class="image"><IMG SRC="Tuvalu.jpg"></div>
	<p>Reason- According to a recent report, the countries with the fewest foreign visitors also have a significant overlap with the list of countries with no reported cases of coronavirus. The logic seems obvious- movement accelerates the spread of the virus- however remoteness does not equate to immunity</p>
	

	<h4>Turkmenistan</h4>
	<p>Turkmenistan's non-remote location in Central Asia brings up questions of its ability to ward off the COVID-19 pandemic, which has touched all but one continent in the world. Still, the country has not officially acknowledged any coronavirus cases, though its officials have restricted all commercial travel, mass religious events and encourage social distancing and mask wearing, The Associated Press reports.</p>
	<div class="image"><IMG SRC="Turkmenistan.jpg"></div>
	<p>Reason- In early February, Turkmenistan cancelled flights to China and other nations with high rates of COVID-19 infections. It also diverted all incoming international flights to Turkmenabat, the country's second-largest city where a special quarantine zone was created to check passengers for symptoms. However, according to the BBC, locals had reported that some passengers had been able to bribe their way out of the quarantine zone and avoid the mandatory two-weeks of isolation. Then, in March, Turkmenistan reportedly closed most of its land borders as well to curb the entry of incoming passengers. Due to strict government controls over the dissemination of information, it is difficult to assess the ground situation in context of COVID-19 in the country. </p>
	

	<h4>Tokelau</h4>

	<p>Consisting of three tropical coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean, Tokelau is a dependent territory of New Zealand, although both governments in New Zealand and Tokelau call it a nation. The three atolls have a combined land area of 4 square miles, and the capital rotates annually between the three atolls. With no airport, Tokelau is accessible primarily by ship. With a population of about 1,500 residents,
	Tokelau calls itself the first nation to be completely powered by renewable energy.</p>
	<div class="image"><IMG SRC="Tokelau.jpg"></div>
	<p>Reason- Several isolation centres are being built across the three atolls in preparation for any suspected or confirmed cases. On Atafu they have had to get creative: an old hotel has been repurposed, and the school building has been renovated in case it's needed for an overflow of patients. Isolating on the thin, beach-laden rings of land that make up Tokelau's atolls is a unique challenge. In some cases, designated isolation centres sit just 200 metres from the main villages. Locals on Atafu have constructed temporary shelters on outer islets in case the population needs to spread out.</p>

<!--Precautions-->
<div class="content-area">
	<A NAME=Section10></A>
<h3>Precautions COVID-19 Survivors Should Take Over The Next Two Years To Reduce The Co-Mortality Rate</h3>
<ul type=”circle”>
	<li>Continue social distancing, at least 6 feet apart. In fact, stay home as much as you can.</li>
	<li>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds.</li>
	<div class="image"><IMG SRC= "pre.png" width= 300px></div>
	<li>Don't touch surfaces out in public.</li>
	<li>Wear a mask or cloth face covering when you are out in areas where it's hard to social distance.</li>
	<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw it away. If you don't have a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your long sleeve at the elbow fold.</li>
	<li>Try not to touch your mouth, nose or eyes.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Preparation-->
<div class="content-area">
	<A NAME=Section11></A>
	<h3>How Can We Prepare Ourselves For The Next Pandemic On A Local As Well As Global Scale?</h3>
		<div class="image"><IMG SRC= "mask.jpg" width= 200px></div>
	<p>Pandemics and large-scale outbreaks can claim millions of lives, disrupt societies and devastate economies. WHO's Health Emergencies Programme (WHE) is working with Member States to help countries to prepare for large-scale outbreaks and pandemics.</p>
	<p>Through the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (APSED III), core capacities required by the International Health Regulations (2005), or IHR, are being advanced, providing an important foundation for pandemic preparedness. This is complemented by efforts to strengthen disease-specific systems and capacities, including for vaccines, pharmaceuticals and other public health interventions. Countries are also encouraged to engage the whole of society for effective pandemic preparedness and response.</p>
	<p>As the next pandemic is most likely to be caused by influenza, the disease continues to be the priority public health threat in the Region. WHE continues to work with Member States to strengthen prevention, surveillance, and response capacities for seasonal and zoonotic influenza with pandemic potential.</p>
</div>

<!--Mutation-->
<div class="content-area">
	<A NAME=Section12></A>
	<h3>What Is Mutation?</h3>
		<p>In biology, a mutation is a change in the genetic material. This means changes to the DNA or to the chromosomes which carry the DNA. These changes are heritable (can be passed on to the next generation) unless they have lethal effects.</p>
</div>

<!--Mutations Of CVOID-19-->
<div class="content-area">
	<A NAME=Section13></A>
	<h3>Possible Mutations Of COVID-19 Which May Occur In Future</h3>
	<p>The new coronavirus is an RNA virus: a collection of genetic material packed inside a protein shell. Once an RNA virus makes contact with a host, it starts to make new copies of itself that can go on to infect other cells. RNA viruses, like the flu and measles, are more prone to changes and mutations compared with DNA viruses, such as herpes, smallpox, and human papillomavirus (HPV).</p>
	<p>"In the world of RNA viruses, change is the norm. We expect RNA viruses to change frequently. That's just their nature", said Dr. Mark Schleiss, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and investigator with the Institute for Molecular Virology at the University of Minnesota.
	SARS-CoV-2 is no exception, and over the past few months it has been mutating.</p>
	<p>But the virus has mutated at a very slow pace. And when it does mutate, the new copies aren't far off from the original virus.</p>
	<h3>It's Possible Impact</h3>
	<p>The lower case fatality ratio in the country, the very high levels of asymptomatic cases, does not indicate that these variants are more dangerous versions. We should remember that the virus needs a host to survive, multiply and spread further. All organisms need to develop an optimal relationship with their host to survive and propagate. If the pathogen (virus or bacteria) is lethal, it kills the host organism. (human or animal) and if the sufficient number of hosts die, the virus dies out too. Which the virus would not like to! So, it is in its own interest to not mutate into such a severe strain that it dies out. The current strain of COVID-19 continues to live and propagate and spread efficiently.</p>
